Announced in February 2013, it was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2015.

                            <p>TThis is the new standard for open world role-playing games. There is no such thing as a perfect game, but The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt come as close to perfect as any RPG to date.</p>

                            <p>Amazing game, it is the best RPG in recent years. It is an amazing story and unforgettable atmosphere of the dark fantasy. I like open world is very large and comfortable, also the characters are very natural and colorful.  

                            <p>Probably the best open-world RPG ever made, but it still falls prey to some of the genre's worst traps. </p>
